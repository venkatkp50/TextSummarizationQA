In fact, Hu et al analysis shows large heterogeneity in their analyses measured by I 2 index. Identifying and quantifying the heterogeneity, using the appropriate analysis based on the heterogeneity as fixed or random models of analysis, prediction intervals, subgroups analyses, and meta-regression are required [3] to better and precise estimation for the effect size in the meta-analysis that will be one of the primary factors for COVID-19 evidence-based practice.3-Availability of meta-analysis data. Because of the growing number in COVID-19 researches, meta-analysis, and updated meta-analysis will be increased. The availability of meta-analysis statistical data and assessment of quality or risk of bias in included articles will make conducting of new meta-analysis or updated meta-analysis easier and faster with all respect for institutions' policies, and copyrights.
