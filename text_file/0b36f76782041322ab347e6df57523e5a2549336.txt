Introduction

performed on variants of global concern identified in Europe, America and Africa, where the infections 61 were severe and the fatality rates high [15] [16] [17] . However, studies on the effect of variants identified in 62Thailand are limited [18] [19] [20] [21] . 63In this study, we aim to provide structural insights into SARS-CoV-2 spike variants identified 64 in Thailand to obtain insights into SARS-CoV-2 Thai outbreaks and identify variants of interest which 65 may require additional investigations. 66were from Thailand and contained 52 spike variants. Forty-one of these variants could be mapped onto 114 a phylogenetic tree (Figure 1 ). Two major clusters of strains from the first and second SARS-CoV-2 115Thai outbreaks were identified. The first outbreak contained variants from seven clades of SARS-CoV-116 2 strains. Although the variant of global concern p.D614G was already detected in many strains since 117March 2020, it became the prevalent strain in the second outbreak (clade GH, Figure 1) . 118Six SARS-CoV-2 spike variants, p.T51N, p.P57T, p.I68R, p.S205T, p.K278T, p.G832C, were 119 unique to Thai strains and not identified in genetic sequences from other countries. Notably, three 120 variants (p.I68R, p.S205T, and p.G832C) were found during the first outbreak, and one (p.K278T) was 121 found during the second outbreak. The other two Thailand-specific variants (p.T51N and p.P57T), 122 which co-localized in one genomic sequence, could not be mapped onto the phylogenetic tree (ID: 123 708814, clade: GH, collected on 9 October 2020). This strain had a total of 11 variants: eight of them -124 p.V47A, p.T51N, p.Q52K, p.F55L, p.P57T, p.V70L, p.S71P, and p.A688P -were not shared by any 125 other Thai strains. When the whole genome of this record was used in a BLAST search against SARS-126CoV-2 records on the GISAID web server, similar strains were found mainly in samples from Saudi 127Arabia (data not shown). This suggests that this strain was not a result of local transmission but may 128 have been introduced into Thailand from overseas and later mutated to contain the two unique variants 129 p.T51N and p. P57T. 130 No structural changes to the spike trimer and the spike-hACE2 interaction were identified with the 140 exception of p.S205T, which was predicted to reduce the structural stability of the spike protein due to 141 drastic reduction of a surface cavity. Cavity alteration has been shown to affect protein stability [14-142 16]. Hence, it is likely that this variant is deleterious to the virus. Recently, p.I68R was discovered in a 143 mutagenesis study of SARS-CoV-2 strains in mice and reported to be associated with the virus's ability 144to escape neutralising antibodies [29] . However, whether this variant enhances the viral escape 145 mechanism in humans is yet to be elucidated. Despite no structural damage found from p.K278T, the 146 extra h-bond formed between the main chain of Thr278 and the side chain of Thr286 was due to the 147 side chain repacking of Thr286 rather than the mutation from Lys278 to Thr278. Nevertheless, the fact 148 that all of the six Thailand-specific variants were rare (found in < 1% of the samples collected) could 149 imply that they are unlikely to enhance the virus's transmissibility. We next examined additional 150 variants identified in Thailand (the full structural analysis of the 52 spike variants found in Thailand is 151 provided in Supplementary Table 1) South East Asian countries [32, 33] . The higher transmissibility of p.D614G can also explain the higher outbreak. No clear structural damage was identified by our analysis. Variant p.S459F was predicted to 165 disrupt an H-bond formed within surface residues (an H-bond linking Arg457 and Ser459 was disrupted 166 when the variant was simulated on PDB 6XR8, while a disruption of an H-bond formed between two 167 consecutive residues Ser459 and Asn460 was detected when tested on PDB 4M0J), which is likely to 168 be compensated by the interaction with nearby water molecules and therefore not structurally 169 destabilising. Variant p.L5F was a newly emerging variant in the second Thai outbreak. It is located 170 near the N-terminal of the spike protein. Unfortunately, this residue was not covered by the available 171 3D coordinates and no structural analysis could be performed. Variant p.S939F was not predicted to 172 affect the structure of the spike trimer or its interaction with ACE2. Accordingly, a previous study 173 suggested that this variant is not likely to enhance SARS-CoV-2 infectivity [34] . is a critical residue for spike-hACE2, and its substitution to tyrosine is a variant of concern. However, 191 our analysis did not suggest that the asparagine to threonine substitution may cause any major structural Interestingly, despite analysing nearly 500,000 sequences, some residues in the SARS-CoV-2 195 spike protein did not contain any variant. Many of these highly conserved residues are clustered in the 196 receptor-binding domain, which binds to the human ACE2 and triggers host cell invasion [12, 13, 35] , 197 and the Coronavirus S2 domain, which mediates viral cell membrane fusion [41] . The lack of variants 198 in these regions may suggest biological importance of those particular residues on protein folding and/or 199 interaction. As genetic variations are usually maintained by natural selection, any alteration on these 200 highly conserved residues could be deleterious to the survival of the virus. Conserved domains and 201 residues could therefore serve as biomarkers [42] or promising drug targets against SARS-CoV-2 [41, 202 43] . 203One limitation in this study is that the Thai sequences available on NCBI and GISAID were 204 from two sources: the state quarantines and domestic hospitals/research institutions. The strains 205 collected in the state quarantine zones are likely imported in Thailand and less likely to cause local 206 transmission. Unfortunately, the available data did not allow to distinguish the variant source. Hence, 207 the number of variants found in Thailand in this study could be an overestimation of the variants that 208 actually caused local transmissions. Nevertheless, it is always important to keep tracking of possible 209 new strains as the mutation rate is very high in single-stranded RNA viruses compared to DNA viruses 210 [44] . The high mutation rate poses a great challenge for developing vaccines [45] , highlighting why 211 incorporating conserved residue information into structural analyses could be essential for discovering 212 other alternative measures for COVID-19 diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. 213Another limitation is that at the time of this study only the 3D coordinates of the spike trimer 214 and the spike-hACE2 interaction were available. Recently, the spike protein was reported to bind to 215 other human proteins, such as CD209 [46] , HAVCR1 [47] , and NRP1 [48, 49] , and other mammal 216 proteins [50] . Therefore, in this study, the number of interface residues could have been underestimated, 217and it is possible that in the future, additional variants will be classified according to their effect on 218 additional virus-host interaction. It is well established that interface residues are hot spots for disease 219 variants [51-53]. The p.N501Y is an example that shows how viral variants occurring at protein 220 interface could increase viral transmissibility and highlights that any SARS-CoV-2 variant occurring at 221 the spike trimer interface or spike-hACE2 interface should be carefully analysed. 222 223

Conclusions 224

In this study, we explored the structural effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike variants identified in 225Thailand, highlighting how the second Thai outbreak was likely caused by the variant of global concern 226 p.D614G. Additionally, we highlighted highly conserved residues on the spike protein, which could
