Modeling SARS-CoV-2 transmission and vaccination 60 In the susceptible-infectious-removed SIR transmission model, we account for corresponding to highly transmissible variants currently circulating globally, with R0 86 up to 6. We do not assume any social distancing in the main scenario, although we run 87 sensitivity analyses with different levels of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs).

Under any scenario, the mean incidence of newly infected 99 individuals never reaches 20 over 10,000 residents ( Fig. 1D-F Although vaccine-induced immunity is not enough to prevent viral circulation, all the 113 scenarios considered are associated with substantial mitigation of COVID-19 burden. 114 We estimate the infection attack rate for the three vaccination strategies to decrease by 115 more than 90% with respect to a reference scenario with no interventions, with 116 cumulative infection attack rates in the range of 554 to 0.12 per 10,000 individuals.

Strategy 2-3 achieve the highest reduction (close to 100%) thanks to the inclusion of These results were based on the assumption of an "all-or-nothing" vaccine (i.e., a 128 vaccinated individual will either develop full protection with probability given by the 129 vaccine efficacy or zero protection). To test the robustness of our findings to this 130 assumption, we also tested a "leaky" vaccine (i.e., the susceptibility to infection of 131 any vaccinated individual is reduced by a factor equal to the vaccine efficacy 25 ) and 132 .

Moreover, the obtained results are confirmed when the initial number of 134 seeds is varied in the range from 10 to 100 (Fig. S5 in SI Appendix), and when equal 135 susceptibility to infection by age is assumed (Fig. S6 in SI Appendix). Finally, we also 136 conducted a counterfactual analysis where we assume that a part of the population 137 was already immune before the start of the vaccination campaign (similar to the 138 situation in Western countries). Under this assumption, we found that a 10% initial 139 immunity proportion would lead to Re below the epidemic threshold for strategy 3 140 before September 1, the start date of the simulations (Fig. S7 in SI Appendix).

As regard the parameters regulating the vaccination process, we found that the 143 (overall) vaccine efficacy has the largest impact, followed by the vaccine efficacy of The findings presented thus far suggest that herd immunity cannot be built through 152 vaccination by September 1, 2021. Next, we test to what extent the start of a new 153 epidemic wave needs to be delayed (e.g., by keeping strict restriction for international 154 .

According to the daily vaccine capacity used in the baseline scenario 156 (based on the history of daily vaccination capacity data up to May 23, 2021), we 157 estimate that Re remains above the epidemic threshold for strategy 1 even if the 158 epidemic is delayed to November 1, 2021 ( Fig. 3A and Fig. S12 in SI Appendix). 159 However, simulation results show that for strategy 2 and 3 it is possible to decrease Re 160 below the epidemic threshold when the epidemic start is delayed until after November The results presented so far suggest that herd immunity is not achievable at any time moderate NPIs are adopted, strategy 2 can succeed in blocking transmission (Fig. 4B) .

Key steps 353 will be the authorization of COVID-19 vaccines for children and minimize vaccine 354 hesitancy. These, together with highly efficacious vaccines, will be even more crucial 355 given the global spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants with higher transmission potential 356 than the historical lineages.
